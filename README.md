The data model is actually developed in [VODSL](https://github.com/pahjbo/vodsl) in direcory [src/main/vodsl](./src/main/vodsl), although the definitive 
representation is of course in VO-DML. An eclipse editor that can act as an IDE for 
vodsl can be installed by following [these instructions](https://github.com/pahjbo/vodsl#installation-of-pre-built-editor)

You should follow the usual [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for making actual changes
to the model or standard document. It is also possible to contribute suggestions and errata by opening an [issue](./issues)
