## High-level design requirements

The proposal part model is primarily designed from the proposing astronomer's point-of-view, and does not contain all of the technical detail
that would be necessary from the observatory point-of-view to actually perform detailed instrument set-up for instance, though it does
strive to provide all the information necessary to schedule observations. Some top-level requirements that follow from this approach are;


* The science goal is uppermost
   - specify the target objects.
   - necessary physics goals on the observation.
* Specifics of instrumental configuration are not considered - only the broad physics of what the instrument should achieve


In addition there are some other high level requirements of how the review should work that have driven the design;


* It should be easy to reuse the proposal for many observatories.
* Proposers should be anonymous to the reviewers (who indeed should be anonymous to the proposers).
* Being able to use the proposal information on-line and off-line - to some extent this is the raison d'Ãªtre of a data model
in providing a language to transfer information between systems.



The proposal management part of the model adds extra information that the observatory needs to specify what resources are available
and to provide a method of scoring the proposal. This is deliberately created as a separate part of the overall model to help
to enforce the separation in functions so that the same proposal might be more easily submitted to several observatories.
