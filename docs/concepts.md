Main Concepts
=============

A [Principal Investigator](../generated/proposal/Person/) is interested in one or more [Targets](../generated/proposal/Target/) and they decide that they want to create an [Observing Proposal](../generated/proposal/ObservingProposal/) to study them. They write a [Science Justification](../generated/proposal/Justification/) to try to persuade the [Time Allocation Committee](../generated/proposalManagement/TAC/) for a particular [Observatory](../generated/proposal/Observatory/) to allocate some [Observations](../generated/proposal/Observation/) on one or more [Telescopes](../generated/proposal/Telescope/) that they operate.
