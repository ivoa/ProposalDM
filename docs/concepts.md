Main Concepts
=============

## Overview

A [Principal Investigator](../generated/proposal/Person/) is interested in one or more [Targets](../generated/proposal/Target/) and they decide that they want to create an [Observing Proposal](../generated/proposal/ObservingProposal/) to study them. They write a [Science Justification](../generated/proposal/Justification/) to try to persuade the [Time Allocation Committee](../generated/proposalManagement/TAC/) for a particular [Observatory](../generated/proposalManagementproposalManagement/Observatory/) to allocate some [Observations](../generated/proposal/Observation/) on one or more [Telescopes](../generated/proposalManagement/Telescope/) which they operate. These telescopes might in turn act in unison to form a [TelescopeArray](../generated/proposalManagement/TelescopeArray/ ).

## Detail
### Observation

An [Observation](../generated/proposal/Observation/) is a particular pointing of the telescope for a particular time period - the area of the sky that will observed is defined by a  [Field](../generated/proposal/Field/), the observation may also be specifically looking at some known [Targets](../generated/proposal/Target/) although the field definition allows for "search" style observations. The observation will also have a
[TechnicalGoal](../generated/proposal/TechnicalGoal/) which itself consists of some desired [PerformanceParameters](../generated/proposal/PerformanceParameters/) and the frequency setup consisting of some [ScienceSpectalWindow](../generated/proposal/ScienceSpectalWindow/)s which might also define some [ExpectedSpectralLine](../generated/proposal/ExpectedSpectralLine/)s. In addition the observation might have some [ObservingConstraint](../generated/proposal/ObservingConstraint/)s which might relate to [time](../generated/proposal/TimingConstraint/) or [pointing](../generated/proposal/PointingConstaint/).

### Proposal Cycle
Each [Observatory](../generated/proposalManagement/Observatory/) can time box they observing sessions into [ProposalCycle](../generated/proposalManagement/ProposalCycle/)s in which they can offer a particular set of [ObservingMode](../generated/proposalManagement/ObservingMode/)s. Each observing mode ties together paticular sets of [ObservingPlatform](../generated/proposalManagement/ObservingPlatform/)s, [Instrument](../generated/proposalManagement/Instrument/)s,  [Backend](../generated/proposalManagement/Backend/)s and [Filter](../generated/proposalManagement/Filter/)s.

### The Submission process

A proposal may be submitted concurrently to several proposal cycles that are current for any of the Observatories that are offering observing time. The proposal then becomes a [SubmittedProposal](../generated/proposalManagement/SubmittedProposal/) in each of the [ProposalCycle](../generated/proposalManagement/ProposalCycle/)s. The submitted proposal ties together the actual [ObservingMode](../generated/proposalManagement/ObservingMode/)s for each [Observation](../generated/proposal/Observation/) via an [ObservationConfiguration](../generated/proposalManagement/ObservationConfiguration/).

### The Review process

Each [Reviewer](../generated/proposalManagement/Reviewer/) adds a [ProposalReview](../generated/proposalManagement/ProposalReview/) to the [SubmittedProposal](../generated/proposalManagement/SubmittedProposal/). Once all of the reviews have been collated the [Time Allocation Committee](../generated/proposalManagement/TAC/) can decide whether to approve a proposal at which point it becomes an [AllocatedProposal](../generated/proposalManagement/AllocatedProposal/) with an [AllocationGrade](../generated/proposalManagement/AllocationGrade/) and some [AllocatedBlock](../generated/proposalManagement/AllocatedBlock/) of some [Resource](../generated/proposalManagement/Resource/).
