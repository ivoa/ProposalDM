Generated Code
==============

## Java
At the moment only the Java code that is generated which is published to the maven central repository.  Note that this is only published as a snapshot version as yet, so that for many tools you will need to explicitly add the snapshot repository to your setup - e.g. for gradle

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        /*
        add this repository to pick up the SNAPSHOT version of the IVOA base library - in the future when this
        will not be necessary when this library is released as a non-SNAPSHOT version.
         */
        maven {
            url= uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
        }
    }
}

```

then the maven "coordinates" for the model library are

   * *groupID*: org.javastro.ivoa.dm
   * *artifactID*: proposaldm
   * *version* ![Maven metadata URL](https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Foss.sonatype.org%2Fcontent%2Frepositories%2Fsnapshots%2Forg%2Fjavastro%2Fivoa%2Fdm%2Fproposaldm%2Fmaven-metadata.xml).

 
The [JavaDoc](generated/javadoc/index.html) describe the code in detail, but it is worth reading the generic description of the patterns in the [java generated from VO-DML tools](https://ivoa.github.io/vo-dml/JavaCodeGeneration/#characteristics-of-the-generated-code) as that will combined with the autogenerated model documentation will probably help comprehension more quickly than just relying on the javadoc.

## Schema
There are [schema](./schema.md) that can be used to validate instances of the model created either with the standard code - or perhaps more usefully as interchange with other code (as the standard code is guaranteed to produce valid instances!).
