Some Outstanding issues
========================

* source specifics - eg for PSRs, knowing period etc. - is this necessary at this stage?
* instrument -> telescope -> backend model sufficient? instrument "modes"?
* scoring systems
* resource availability? Does time deserve its own type?
* constraints model sufficient? Weather?

extensions?
----------

Most of these ideas are probably out of scope, unless a really well-defined subset of the desired information is available.
They are part of a bigger system of which proposals are really a subset.

* storing information about when the observations occurred - might be useful for follow-up proposals
* links to publications?
