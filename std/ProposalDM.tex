\begin{abstract}
This document and associated files define a data model in VO-DML that is intended to be suitable for exchanging
    information pertaining to making observation proposals. It is envisaged that the model will be useful in two scenarios.
\begin{itemize}
    \item transferring information between different Observatories' application processes.
    \item observatory scheduling systems being able to automatically extract source lists.
\end{itemize}
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}


The concept of a common proposal DM was discussed in \cite{2008SPIE.7019E..0PB}.

\url{https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2018/proposal-tools-workshop.html}

One of the main inspirations is the Alma Project Data model
\cite{alma:projdm} from which several ideas have been reused.


\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to role_diagram.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy role_diagram.xml,
% you must remove role_diagram.pdf from SOURCES in the Makefile.

Fig.~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the
IVOA architecture \citep{2010ivoa.rept.1123A}.
