\begin{abstract}
This document and associated files define a data model in VO-DML that is intended to be suitable for exchanging
    information pertaining to making observation proposals. It is envisaged that the model will be useful in two scenarios.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transferring information between different Observatories' observing time application processes.
    \item Observatory scheduling systems being able to automatically extract information such as source lists.
\end{itemize}

    The model is developed at \url{https://github.com/ivoa/ProposalDM}.

\section{Introduction}


The concept of a common project DM was discussed in \cite{2008SPIE.7019E..0PB}, and whilst this model limits itself to
only the proposal part, the general concept of attempting this level of interoperability is inspired by that paper.

There was a workshop held at ESO \url{https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2018/proposal-tools-workshop.html} which reviewed
proposal systems, and this model tries to benefit from the lessons learnt during that workshop.

The detail of the model derives inspiration from two particular sources;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The data model from the NorthStar tool (TODO cite)
    \item The Alma Project Data model \cite{alma:projdm}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

% As of ivoatex 1.2, the architecture diagram is generated by ivoatex in
% SVG; copy ivoatex/archdiag-full.xml to role_diagram.xml and throw out
% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy role_diagram.xml,
% you must remove role_diagram.pdf from SOURCES in the Makefile.

Fig.~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the
IVOA architecture \citep{2010ivoa.rept.1123A}.


\section{High-level design requirements}

The proposal part model is primarily designed from the proposing astronomer's point-of-view, and does not contain all of the technical detail
that would be necessary from the observatory point-of-view to actually perform detailed instrument set-up for instance, though it does
strive to provide all the information necessary to schedule observations. Some top-level requirements that follow from this approach are;

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The science goal is uppermost
    \begin{itemize}
        \item specify the target objects.
        \item necessary physics goals on the observation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Specifics of instrumental configuration are not considered - only the broad physics of what the instrument should achieve
\end{enumerate}

In addition there are some other high level requirements of how the review should work that have driven the design;

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It should be easy to reuse the proposal for many observatories.
    \item Proposers should be anonymous to the reviewers (who indeed should be anonymous to the proposers).
    \item Being able to use the proposal information on-line and off-line - to some extent this is the \textit{raison d'\^{e}tre} of a data model
          in providing a language to transfer information between systems.
\end{enumerate}


The proposal management part of the model adds extra information that the observatory needs to specify what resources are available
and to provide a method of scoring the proposal. This is deliberately created as a separate part of the overall model to help
to enforce the separation in functions so that the same proposal might be more easily submitted to several observatories.

It should be noted that there is easier to navigate documentation of the model published at \url{https://ivoa.github.io/ProposalDM/}.
